As an atheist, far be it from me to tell you what a Christian is, I get that. Yet, there's this persistent "Jesus was a socialist" trend among liberals that has seriously got to stop. On the face of it, it seems to make sense. With some cherry-picking, Jesus' focus on the poor and the least of these looks to be aligned perfectly with the liberal agenda. But with just an ounce of thought it immediately begins to break down. Jesus was trying to change the hearts and minds of individuals by modeling his own behavior and love for mankind. He wanted to change society from the bottom up, one individual soul at a time, not from the top down, through coercive central planning. There is no such thing as a Christian nation. Only individual people act, a nation is not a person, it does not have a soul.

You want others to care about the poor? How about you get off your high horse, stop pointing the government guns at people, through coercive central planning, go help the poor with your own time and energy, and model the behavior you want to see in the world. What would Jesus do? I don't know, but I know what he wouldn't be doing.
