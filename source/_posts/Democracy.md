**Democracy: some random dude gets to check a box and decide how you live YOUR life.**

Without making claims on how democracy really works or taking a controversial position on democracy, just taking the conventional view of democracy, under the best light and distilling it down to its logical conclusion, what can be said? All that can really be said is that some random stranger, whose intentions are unknown, whose education and background are unknown, is given the high privilege of going to the ballot *in secret*, checking a box, and making decisions on how *you* should live *your* life.

Why is this acceptable to you? Seriously think about this question. The average "citizen" cares more about the gender of Bruce Jenner than they do about your life. Yet they get to make decisions on how your children are educated, who you're allowed trade with, who you're allowed to marry, what you're allowed to do with your own body, how you should spend your money, and the list goes on and on. And if you don't comply, it's acceptable that these same people get to delegate the right (a right they do not have) to kidnap you and put you into a cage, and possibly murder you if you resist. Why is this considered civilized?
