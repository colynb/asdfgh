"Who will build the roads?"

Lots of people have all kinds of legitimate questions about life in a stateless society. The obvious being about the roads. It's a fair question. Other questions around crime, justice, foreign defense, welfare, disease, are all equally valid questions. Rather than describing in detail what the free market might be able to come up with to solve these issues (because it's already been done, there's a lot of information you can get from Google if you're interested), I've come up with a fairly succinct *most honest* response to anyone who asks such questions:

**"I don't know. How much is it worth to you?"**

I don't know what to do about crime. How much is it worth to you to live in a safe neighborhood?

I don't know how children without any means will be educated. How much is it worth to you to make sure poor kids are educated?

I don't know how you can defend yourself from foreign invaders. How much is it worth to you to feel safe from foreign invasion?

I don't know who will build roads safe to drive on. How much is it worth to you to drive on safe roads?

I don't know how space exploration will be possible without a state. How much is it worth to you to send someone to Mars?

This question is a kind of litmus test for those who make excuses for violence yet claim to have the moral high ground. Here are some reason why I think this question is instructive:

1. Asking what something, anything, is worth to an individual, forces them to evaluate the subjective nature of the value they place in that thing. Value is not universal.
2. Since value is not universal the value they place in the thing becomes a personal preference.
3. Now they have to ask, is it legitimate to use force to see that their personal preferences are met.
4. It also emphasizes that given enough people who share similar values and are willing to spend money, then the thing they value can just as easily and more humanely be provided by the free market.
5. *If* on the other hand the individual admits that there isn't a market for the thing they value, they're back to asking the question raised in point 3... is it legitimate to use force to see that their personal preferences are met given that most people don't value the same thing they value.

If you think you're someone who falls within this category, if the thing you value is really that important to you, show me the money! Put your money where your mouth is. Don't pretend that forcing peaceful people, threatening them with violence for non-compliance, for not funding your personal preferences, gives you any kind of moral high ground. Don't use violence to pretend there are guarantees in life. There are no guarantees in life, only costs and benefits. Please do the right thing.
