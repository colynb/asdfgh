So you're about to retire and you're going to start taking social security. Congratulations!

Before you do, I'm going to say something that has the potential to make you very angry.

There are basically two camps when the issue of social security comes up in conversations. First, you have liberals who generally accept social security as an overall positive good for society. It's "society's" duty to support the elderly. As a libertarian, and for the purposes of my argument, I'm going to take for granted that this view of social security is just stupid, I'm not going to go into why. It's actually the traditionally conservative view of social security I want to poke holes into.

The traditionally conservative view of Social Security is, first and foremost, completely unconstitutional. I can't agree more. Conservatives also think social security should not be managed by the government and can be better managed through 401Ks and other types of tax shelters.
