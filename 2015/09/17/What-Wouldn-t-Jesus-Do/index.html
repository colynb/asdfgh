Yet, there’s this persistent, illogical, “Jesus was a socialist” trend among liberals that I feel qualified to speak on. On the face of it, this idea seems to make sense. At least with some cherry-picking, Jesus’ focus on the poor and the “least of these” looks to be aligned perfectly with the liberal agenda. But with just an ounce of thought it immediately begins to break down. Jesus was trying to change the hearts and minds of individuals by modeling his own behavior and love for mankind. He wanted to change society from the bottom up, one individual soul at a time, not from the top down coercive central planning. Also, there is no such thing as a Christian nation, there are only individuals that live within national borders, and it is only they who have beliefs. Nations do not have souls. Personifying abstract notions like nations, especially within politics, is pure rhetoric, designed to block you from thinking logically about problems and their solutions. As such, you work to change the hearts of real people, individual by individual, not nations through political violence.</p>
<p>You want others to care about the poor as deeply as you say you do? How about you get off your high horse, stop pointing the government guns at people, through coercive central planning, go help the poor with your own time and energy, and model the behavior you want to see in the world. What would Jesus do? I don’t know, but I know what he wouldn’t be doing.</p>
<p>Lastly, <a href="http://voluntaryist.com/fundamentals/introduction.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Voluntaryism</a> is the only rational, nonmagical approach to fixing society. It’s not a silver bullet as it requires changing hearts and minds, and sadly that’s just too much work for most people. Easier to point guns than it is to persuade.</p>
