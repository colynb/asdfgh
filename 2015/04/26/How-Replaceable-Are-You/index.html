Prices are determined by the relationship between supply and demand. Thus the price of your labor is affected by the supply of labor and demand for labor. All other things being equal, if the supply of labor in a particular sector is low, that is, there aren’t enough skilled workers to meet demand, then the price of labor will be high. Inversely, if the supply of labor is high, that is, there are more than enough laborers to meet demand, then the price for that labor will be low.</p>
<p>It’s no coincidence that those who fight for minimum wage laws, are those who are in industries with very large supplies of labor, where as a natural consequence of the bidding process, the prices are kept low. Instead of increasing your skills making your labor relatively in lower supply (increasing your value, thus increasing your price), the usual scape goat is the fat greedy capitalist. But given what we know about supply and demand, why should this be the case? If a large shipment of apples were to make their way into the marketplace, their price will likely go down. The lower price you pay means in the short term, you profit from that lower price. The apple seller makes less money per apple, this is true, but why aren’t you as a consumer of apples fighting to ensure the price of apples is kept high? Are you greedy?</p>
<p>Minimum wage laws are a violent and ineffective way to raise the price of labor. The laws of supply and demand don’t magically disappear because you point a gun at it demanding compliance. To know why, ask yourself what you’d do if the government enforced a higher price for apples, and, is the apple seller better off or worse off as a result?</p>
<p>Do you think you’re not getting paid your worth? All you need to do is ask one simple question. How replaceable are you? Instead of using violence to solve your problems, how about you try something more peaceful and productive. Make yourself irreplaceable.</p>
